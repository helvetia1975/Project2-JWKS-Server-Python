# Project3-JWKS-Server-Python
This set of files creates JWTS on HTTPS port 8080 using RSA key pairs. The server is being enhanced by a SQLite database file in order to document private keys, users, and authentication logs. This server also has control of request frequency, where requests are limited to 10 requests per second. The server can be served on either a POST request to "/register" or a POST request to "/auth". The register endpoint generates a UUIDv4 password and is hashed using Argon2. This is then stored in the SQL database, along with the username and email. The generated password is returned in a response. The auth endpoint creates public and private keys that are served on a JWKS endpoint on the server, checking to make sure the keys are good i.e. not expired. The JWKS server runs indefinitely until interrupted.

Building on Project 2, I was able to create the "users" and "auth_logs" tables, implement the rate limiting functionality, and create the "register" endpoint. Unfortunataely, I was unable to figure out how to log authentication requests and how to encrypt the keys in the table. I was able to run the gradebot and create a test suite, though I am missing some marks from the gradebot and my test coverage is not desirable.
